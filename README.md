# CQuranTree

This solution will be able to traverse the Quranic text (in the Hafs qiraa'ah) for the purpose of exposing the relationship between similar verses and the different chapters they are located in. This project will also be able to analyze the so-called numerological miracles in the Quran to confirm their validity.

One of the future goals of this project is to store the Quranic text in a SQL database to optimize efficiency and allow for the possibility to analyze the Quran with machine learning.
